## Why SystemSim?

Most system design prep is passive — reading articles, watching videos. SystemSim is **active practice**. You drag real infrastructure components onto a canvas, wire them together, simulate production-scale traffic, and get scored the way an interviewer would evaluate you.

It's the flight simulator for system design interviews.

## Features

<div align="center">
  <img src="public/features.svg" alt="Features overview" width="800"/>
</div>

<br/>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 30 Infrastructure Components

Every building block you need for any system design:

**Networking** — DNS, CDN, Load Balancer, API Gateway, Rate Limiter, Reverse Proxy, Origin Shield

**Compute** — App Server, Auth Service, WebSocket Server, Task Scheduler, Stream Processor, Notification Service

**Storage** — SQL DB, NoSQL DB, Cache/Redis, Object Storage, Search/ES, Graph DB, Time-Series DB, Data Warehouse, File Store

**Infrastructure** — Message Queue, Service Mesh, Monitoring, Service Discovery, Distributed Lock, Circuit Breaker, Coordination Service

**Special** — Custom Component (double-click to rename to anything)

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Realistic Specs

Every component has **verified benchmarks**:

| Component | Max QPS | Latency |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Load Balancer | 1,000,000 | 1ms |
| Cache/Redis | 100,000 | 1ms |
| SQL Database | 10,000 | 8ms |
| NoSQL (DynamoDB) | 50,000 | 3ms |
| Kafka | 100,000 | 5ms |
| Elasticsearch | 20,000 | 10ms |
| Object Storage (S3) | 25,000 | 75ms |
| CDN | 500,000 | 15ms |

All values cross-checked against official docs and benchmarks.

### Traffic Simulation

<div align="center">
  <img src="public/traffic-sim.svg" alt="Animated traffic simulation" width="800"/>
</div>

<br/>

- **Kahn's topological sort** for correct fan-in QPS accumulation
- **Smart traffic splitting** — Load balancers split evenly; other components fan-out 100% to each child
- **Per-node metrics** — QPS, utilization %, latency, status (healthy / warning / critical)
- **Delivered-throughput accounting** — reported throughput is capped at offered load and collapses through saturated nodes (no phantom over-capacity numbers)
- **Disconnected-node aware** — stray nodes never steal traffic from the real request path
- **Async-edge aware** — connections marked async are excluded from user-facing latency
- **Bottleneck detection** with cascading failure visualization
- **Cycle detection** that separates true cycle members from nodes merely downstream of a cycle
- **Configurable load** — 1K to 500K requests/sec

### Connectivity-aware scoring

Scoring evaluates the **wired request path**, not a parts bin — a canvas of disconnected components scores "Needs Work", and every check tells you when a component is placed but not connected. Each of the 5 categories is capped at exactly 20 points.

---

### 5-Category Scoring

<div align="center">
  <img src="public/scoring.svg" alt="Animated scoring engine" width="800"/>
</div>

<br/>

Scored like a real interview — across the 5 dimensions interviewers evaluate:

| Category | What it checks |
|----------|---------------|
| **Scalability** | Load balancing, horizontal scaling, caching, async processing |
| **Availability** | No SPOFs, replica redundancy, monitoring, overload protection |
| **Latency** | CDN usage, cache-before-DB patterns, minimal hop count |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Right-sized components, polyglot persistence, no waste |
| **Trade-offs** | Read/write separation, defense in depth, architecture breadth |

Verdicts: **Needs Work** < 31 | **Decent** < 51 | **Good** < 71 | **Excellent** < 86 | **Architect Level** 86+

---

### Interview Practice Mode

<div align="center">
  <img src="public/interview-flow.svg" alt="6-phase interview flow" width="800"/>
</div>

<br/>

Practice like a real 45-minute interview:

1. **Requirements** (5 min) — Clarify functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Estimation** (5 min) — Back-of-envelope calculations
3. **API Design** (5 min) — Define core REST endpoints
4. **Data Model** (5 min) — Design entities and relationships
5. **High-Level Design** (15 min) — Build the architecture on canvas
6. **Deep Dive** (10 min) — Discuss trade-offs and failure modes

Color-coded timer: green (on track) | yellow (over target) | red (significantly over)

---

### Edge Labels & Protocol Types

Label every connection with its protocol and communication style:

| Protocol | Style | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| HTTP | Solid line | App Server -> Database |
| gRPC | Solid + purple badge | Service -> Service |
| WebSocket | Solid + green badge | Client -> WS Server |
| pub/sub | Dashed + amber badge | Queue -> Consumer |
| TCP | Solid + zinc badge | Cache -> App Server |

Click any edge to set protocol, sync/async mode, and a custom label.

---

### Concept Library

Educational content for **every** infrastructure component. Select any component to learn:

- **When to use** — concrete scenarios where this component shines
- **When NOT to use** — common mistakes to avoid
- **Key trade-offs** — engineering considerations
- **Interview tips** — what to say to impress interviewers
- **Common patterns** — Cache-aside, Write-through, etc.
- **Real-world examples** — verified facts from Netflix, Twitter, Uber, etc.

---

### Trade-off Decision Log

21 pre-built trade-off cards with side-by-side comparisons:

SQL vs NoSQL | Push vs Pull | Sync vs Async | Strong vs Eventual Consistency | Monolith vs Microservices | REST vs gRPC | Cache-aside vs Write-through | Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling | Polling vs WebSocket | Single vs Multi-leader | Hash vs Range Partitioning | CDN Push vs Pull | Token Bucket vs Sliding Window | At-least-once vs Exactly-once Processing | Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking | Long-polling vs SSE vs WebSocket | Kafka vs RabbitMQ | JWT vs Session Tokens | Normalization vs Denormalization | Batch vs Stream Processing | Active-active vs Active-passive

Log your own decisions with rationale during practice.

### Mobile & Tablet

Fully usable on touch devices:

- **Tap-to-add** components (HTML5 drag-and-drop doesn't work on touch — tap the `+` or the row instead)
- Left **library drawer** and right **bottom sheet** for panels; canvas stays full-bleed
- Enlarged connection handles and a `connectionRadius` for finger-friendly wiring
- **Remove Connection** button so edges are deletable without a keyboard
- Two-row interview bar with controls always on-screen
- Tap-to-edit text notes and rename custom components; pinch-zoom enabled
- Safe-area insets respected; no horizontal overflow at 375px / 768px / 1024px+

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vijaygupta18/system-design-simulator.git
