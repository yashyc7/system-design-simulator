## Overview

Most system design prep is passive — reading articles, watching videos, memorizing diagrams. **SystemForge makes it active.**

You drag real infrastructure components onto a canvas, wire them into an architecture, run production-scale traffic through it, and get scored across the five dimensions an interviewer actually evaluates. Think of it as a **flight simulator for system design interviews** — a safe place to fail, iterate, and build the intuition that reading alone can't give you.

It runs entirely in your browser. No account, no backend, no data leaves your machine.

```
  Pick a problem  →  Drag & wire components  →  Simulate traffic  →  Get scored  →  Iterate
```

<br/>

### 35 Infrastructure Components

A complete toolbox for any architecture — **35 production-grade components** across five categories, each with verified throughput and latency specs, plus a custom block you can rename to anything.

| Category | Components |
|----------|-----------|
| **Networking** | DNS · CDN · Load Balancer · API Gateway · Rate Limiter · Reverse Proxy · Origin Shield |
| **Compute** | App Server · Auth Service · WebSocket Server · Task Scheduler · Stream Processor · Notification Service |
| **Storage** | SQL · NoSQL · Cache/Redis · Object Storage · Search/ES · Graph DB · Time-Series DB · Data Warehouse · File Store · Vector DB · Geospatial Index |
| **Messaging** | Message Queue · Pub/Sub |
| **Infrastructure** | Service Mesh · Monitoring · Service Discovery · Distributed Lock · Circuit Breaker · Coordination Service · ID Generator · Sharded Counter · Config Service |
| **Special** | Custom Component (double-click to rename) |

Every component ships with **benchmark-backed specs**, cross-checked against official docs:

| Component | Max QPS | Latency | | Component | Max QPS | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Load Balancer | 1,000,000 | 1 ms | | Kafka | 100,000 | 5 ms |
| CDN | 500,000 | 15 ms | | Elasticsearch | 20,000 | 10 ms |
| Cache / Redis | 100,000 | 1 ms | | Object Storage (S3) | 25,000 | 75 ms |
| NoSQL (DynamoDB) | 50,000 | 3 ms | | SQL Database | 10,000 | 8 ms |

### Traffic Simulation

<div align="center">
  <img src="public/traffic-sim.svg" alt="Animated traffic simulation" width="800"/>
</div>

<br/>

Push 1K–500K requests/sec through your design and watch it behave like a real system:

- **Correct fan-in accumulation** via Kahn's topological sort — QPS adds up exactly where it should.
- **Smart traffic splitting** — load balancers split evenly; other components fan out 100% to each child.
- **Per-node metrics** — QPS, utilization %, latency, and status (healthy / warning / critical).
- **Honest throughput** — reported throughput is capped at offered load and collapses through saturated nodes. No phantom over-capacity numbers.
- **Disconnected-node aware** — a stray, unwired node never steals traffic from the real request path.
- **Async-edge aware** — connections marked async are excluded from user-facing latency.
- **Bottleneck & cascading-failure** visualization, plus cycle detection that separates true cycle members from nodes merely downstream of one.

---

### Connectivity-Aware Scoring

<div align="center">
  <img src="public/scoring.svg" alt="Animated scoring engine" width="800"/>
</div>

<br/>

SystemForge scores the **wired request path**, not a parts bin. Drop a cache on the canvas but never connect it, and you get no credit — with feedback telling you exactly why. A pile of disconnected components scores *"Needs Work,"* just like it would in a real interview.

Five categories, each capped at exactly **20 points**:

| Category | What it checks |
|----------|---------------|
| **Scalability** | Load balancing, horizontal scaling, caching, async processing |
| **Availability** | No SPOFs, replica redundancy, monitoring, overload protection |
| **Latency** | CDN usage, cache-before-DB patterns, minimal hop count |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Right-sized components, polyglot persistence, no waste |
| **Trade-offs** | Read/write separation, defense in depth, architecture breadth |

**Verdicts:** Needs Work `<31` · Decent `<51` · Good `<71` · Excellent `<86` · Architect Level `86+`

---

### Interview Practice Mode

<div align="center">
  <img src="public/interview-flow.svg" alt="6-phase interview flow" width="800"/>
</div>

<br/>

Run a full, timed 45-minute mock with a wall-clock-accurate timer (it keeps counting even if you switch tabs) and a phase-by-phase guide:

| # | Phase | Time | Focus |
|---|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | **Requirements** | 5 min | Clarify functional & non-functional requirements |
| 2 | **Estimation** | 5 min | Back-of-the-envelope capacity math |
| 3 | **API Design** | 5 min | Define core endpoints |
| 4 | **Data Model** | 5 min | Entities, relationships, access patterns |
| 5 | **High-Level Design** | 15 min | Build the architecture on the canvas |
| 6 | **Deep Dive** | 10 min | Trade-offs and failure modes |

A color-coded timer keeps you honest: green (on track) · yellow (over target) · red (significantly over).

---

### Concept Library & Trade-off Cards

**Concept Library** — select any component to get interview-ready notes: when to use it, when *not* to, key trade-offs, common patterns (cache-aside, write-through, …), what to say to impress an interviewer, and verified real-world examples from Netflix, Uber, Twitter, and more.

**Edge labels** — click any connection to set its protocol (HTTP · gRPC · WebSocket · pub/sub · TCP) and sync/async mode, rendered with distinct line styles and badges.

**21 Trade-off Cards** — side-by-side comparisons of the decisions interviewers love to probe, with a "when to choose which" for each:

> SQL vs NoSQL · Push vs Pull · Sync vs Async · Strong vs Eventual Consistency · Monolith vs Microservices · REST vs gRPC · Cache-aside vs Write-through · Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling · Polling vs WebSocket · Single vs Multi-leader · Hash vs Range Partitioning · CDN Push vs Pull · Token Bucket vs Sliding Window · At-least-once vs Exactly-once Processing · Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking · Long-polling vs SSE vs WebSocket · Kafka vs RabbitMQ · JWT vs Session Tokens · Normalization vs Denormalization · Batch vs Stream Processing · Active-active vs Active-passive

You can also log your **own** trade-off decisions with rationale as you design.

### Learning Path

A structured progression from your first easy problem to architect-level systems, with concept prerequisites shown per problem and completion tracking.

| Tier | Sample Problems | Focus |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Foundations** | URL Shortener, Rate Limiter, Parking Lot | Core building blocks |
| **Intermediate** | Notification System, Autocomplete, Instagram, Reddit, Tinder | Combining systems |
| **Advanced** | Twitter, Chat, Web Crawler, Dropbox, WhatsApp, Code Editor | Complex distributed systems |
| **Expert** | Uber, YouTube, Payments, Netflix, Zoom, Google Maps, Kafka, Digital Wallet | Multi-concern architectures |

---

### Mobile & Tablet

Genuinely usable on phones and tablets — not just a shrunk desktop:

- **Tap-to-add** components (HTML5 drag-and-drop doesn't work on touch — tap the row or the `+`).
- Left **library drawer** + right **bottom sheet**; the canvas stays full-bleed.
- Finger-friendly wiring (enlarged connection handles + generous hit areas) and a **Remove Connection** button so edges are deletable without a keyboard.
- Two-row interview bar with controls always on screen; tap-to-edit text notes.
- Safe-area insets respected; **no horizontal overflow at 375 / 768 / 1024px+**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** Node.js 18.18+ and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vijaygupta18/system-design-simulator.git
cd system-design-simulator
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** — that's it. Everything runs client-side; your designs are saved to `localStorage`.

### 🐳 Run with Docker

> **Prerequisites:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running.

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t system-forge .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name system-forge system-forge
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** — the same app, fully containerized. Stop with `docker stop system-forge` and start again with `docker start system-forge`.

**Why Docker?** No Node.js setup needed. No `npm install`. One command and you're running — ideal for quick previews, CI/CD pipelines, or deploying on a headless server.
